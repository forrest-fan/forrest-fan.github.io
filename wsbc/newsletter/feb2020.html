  <p>From San Francisco 49ers assistant coach Katie Sowers becoming the first female to coach in the Super Bowl to American Simone Biles earning the title of most decorated gymnast of all time, the spotlight has begun to shine even brighter on women’s sports. As society has begun taking notice of the value of women’s sports as a powerful diversity and inclusion platform, we may finally see the tide turn on issues that have been plaguing these athletes for some time now. </p>

  <p>Women’s sporting events have long been described as an inferior product compared to similar male contests, with less broadcast exposure and lower average attendance. However, this thought has changed. According to Nielsen’s latest “Women and Sport” report, interest in the women’s game from fans in eight of the world’s largest commercial sports markets is 84%, of which 51% are male, showing women’s athletics is very attractive to consumers of any gender. This is backed up by viewership numbers as well; the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup final was played in a sold out Parc Olympique Lyonnais in France with 22% more people tuning in on TV in the U.S. than the men’s final a year before.</p>

  <p>The new WNBA collective bargaining agreement was another important step towards helping turn women’s sports into their own game, rather than it being modeled after the men’s leagues. Players will see a $10,000 increase to minimum salaries, fully paid maternity leave, and better airplane and hotel arrangements when traveling throughout the season. These changes are a sign of women’s leagues becoming more financially sustainable and independent.</p>

  <p>Perhaps most importantly, established international sporting icons such as Serena Williams and Ronda Rousey have paved the way for a new generation of female sporting stars to take advantage of the untapped marketability of top-tier female athletes. Someone like tennis phenom Naomi Osaka will be in high demand for sponsorship opportunities from companies looking to capitalize on her national icon status as the Olympics in Osaka’s home country of Japan nears. Sponsorship of female athletes not only helps the individual, but further increases exposure for the leagues they play in. </p>

  <p>As we can see, much progress has been made to try and level the playing field between men’s and women's sports, but there is still plenty of work to be done. Efforts should continue to be made by corporations to heighten the interest and excitement around women’s athletics and sporting organizations should look to support the pursuit of women in managerial, senior coaching, and officiating roles. </p>

  <h2>Indusry Insights with Whitney Gorges</h2>
  <p>This month, we caught up with Whitney Gorges of Golf Canada to gain a little insight on her current role and the state of women in sport.</p>
  <p style="font-weight:bold">WSBC: Can you describe your current role?</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Whitney:</span> I work as the Partnerships Manager at Golf Canada. I am responsible for managing multiple client accounts inclusive of proposal and fulfillment stages, along with renewals on expiration of agreements, the development and execution of partner and sponsor service plans, and activation concepts in support of Canada’s two National Opens, the RBC Canadian Open and the CP Women’s Open. </p>

  <p style="font-weight:bold">WSBC: Have you had any challenges along the way given the largely male-populated sports industry?</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Whitney:</span> I can't say that I have personally faced immediate challenges in my career to this point as I've had great male and female mentors who believed in me and helped my advancement along the way. However, I have seen first-hand that golf in particular is still lacking female representation at the Senior Management level, industry wide. This is something that the R&A Women in Golf Leadership Development Programme that I'm participating in is trying to address directly.</p>
  <p>(The R&A Women in Golf Leadership Development Programme works to grow golf globally through the increased participation of women at all levels, on and off the course. Learn more about the program <a href="https://www.randa.org/News/2019/11/Womens-Leadership-Development-Programme-Launched" class="text-link">here</a>)</p>

  <p style="font-weight:bold">WSBC: Where do you see opportunities for growth in women’s sports?</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Whitney:</span> There is a massive opportunity for growth in women's sports and it's something that the industry is focused on more than ever before. I think Women's Tennis is probably setting the standard, and the new WNBA CBA is another major step in the right direction. I think we're just scratching the surface and will continue to see more moves like this, but to take it even further we need to see more corporate support for women's professional sport. There are no shortages of studies that indicate that there is interest in women's professional sport from a fan perspective, and that women are the primary purchasers for most households. There is a great opportunity for corporate sponsors to align their brand and invest in women's sports and still get the ROI they're looking for.</p>
