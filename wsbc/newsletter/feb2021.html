  <p>In a sport steeped in tradition, where the equipment market is largely cornered by a few imposing brands, each filling out their payroll with the game’s top players, the challenges haywoodgolf Founder Joshua Haywood faces each day making golf clubs are similar to what we find across the greater sporting landscape. Big budget brands are able to make consumers feel like they have no choice but to buy from them; the direct-to-consumer club manufacturer is looking to change that.. “We implement the Failing Fast method, use what we have proven to work for our business, and repeating that cycle every day.” Haywood explains.</p>
  <p>“I believe we stand out because we care about all our customers and provide exceptional customer service. We have created high quality products that match major OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) brands while providing them at more affordable prices.”</p>
  <p>Small businesses must scratch and claw to get their name out there, while hoping they are able to turn the heads of customers. This holds true for any entrepreneur; however, the sports industry is its own beast. Very resistant to change, the culture of sport (especially golf) is to keep each game as “pure” as possible. Sometimes even the rules of the game can limit creative solutions. This puts small companies looking to enhance sport as a whole at an extreme disadvantage, empowering the brands that sit at the top.</p>
  <p>haywoodgolf was born from a trip to a major golf chain in search of some new wedges. Discontent with the high cost and rather unimpressive offerings, Joshua Haywood decided why not make the club instead. The story can be traced back to more humble beginnings as a kid growing up in Vancouver, Canada.</p>
  <p>“I have played golf since the age of 10, grew up building my clubs and knew just enough to get me into trouble. I had never been involved in the golf industry directly prior to this business, but a lot of research, time and effort went into learning as much as I could before launching the business.” </p>
  <p>Disrupting an industry like golf doesn’t come easy though. The cost to produce clubs isn’t cheap, especially for a boutique manufacturer, and each clubhead would have to be designed from the ground up.  Even Haywood would say as much: “I had a lot of people within the industry that were very helpful and shared a lot of knowledge. Even to this day I am fortunate to say I get little gems from so many different people which help our business.”</p>
  <p>Haywood seeks to build a company that brings golf back down to its purest form, free from the clutter of marketing, “where a swoosh or an extra gleam doesn’t influence the price or the play.” haywoodgolf stands out in field of companies rooted in history by appealing to a “new wave” of golfers. </p>
  <p>“A new wave of golfer could mean new golfers or existing golfers who are now able to play more.” describes Haywood. “Our business is geared towards expanding the game and being able to add as many net new golfers as possible and increase rounds played. By ensuring our clubs provide the same performance as other brands but are more affordable, ultimately means they are more accessible to those who don’t want to spend thousands on clubs. It also means that golfers can use their savings to spend money at local courses for extra rounds, their pro shops, restaurants, etcetera.”</p>
  <p>Start-ups like haywoodgolf are an integral part of pushing sports forward, drumming up interest and ultimately bringing in new customers to the industry as a whole. They modernize the trade with the agility to adapt to specific customer needs, along with caring service that big box brands just can’t reproduce. At the same time, small businesses provide healthy competition for the old guard, pushing them to innovate and create more affordable golf equipment for all consumers. </p>

  <p>Now for some bonus content from my chat with Joshua!</p>
  <p style="font-weight:bold">WSBC: What is one-word or phrase that you could use to describe your journey thus far. Why’d you choose it?</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Joshua:</span> The juice is worth the squeeze. I have a passion for golf that exceeds anything else which is why I decided to start a golf company.</p>

  <p style="font-weight:bold">WSBC: With the recent release of your driving iron, what more can we expect from haywoodgolf in the future?</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Joshua:</span> The driving iron was released a couple weeks ago, and they are flying of the shelves so to speak. We are always working on new things, but we don’t launch products just to launch something new every year. Every product is made with purpose to complete something missing in our lineup or improve on an existing product. As a newer company, we are always wanting to provide more options, but like most self-funded start-ups, money can prevent you from doing specific things until you reach a certain level. We are growing as fast as the business allows us to. </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold">WSBC: What advice would you have for a budding entrepreneur?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Joshua:</span></p>
<ol>
    <li>Better make sure you have thick skin</li>
    <li>Don’t listen to haters (especially family members/friends)</li>
    <li>Trust your idea, skills and abilities and disregard anything negative anyone says to you, about you or your business.</li>
    <li>Make sure you are prepared to go the distance. Media these days typically focuses on those ‘quick win’ businesses that grew overnight to millions (which isn’t usually true anyway) and for 99.5 percent of businesses that doesn’t happen. It is mostly likely going to take you 2-4 years to get to a point where you taste success (depending on your level of expectation)</li>
    <li>Don’t compare yourself to anyone else or another business. Everyone has a different journey.</li>
    <li>Celebrate your wins, but make sure you move on quickly and focus on getting to that next level.</li>
    <li>If you take advice from someone, make sure you know they have your best interest at heart.</li>
    <li>Always focus on your customers first and foremost. They are who keep your business running. Bite your tongue when its hard (you will have those customers) and always make sure they know you appreciate their business.</li>
    <li>Be unique. Try new methods of engaging with your customers and always reply to your social media messages – you’d be surprised how many times this leads to a sale.</li>
    <li>Be authentic. Be yourself. Be true to why you started your business.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bonus: ENJOY IT. BE GRATEFUL. YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO START, OWN and RUN YOUR OWN BUSINESS and GO KICK SOME ASS!</p>
