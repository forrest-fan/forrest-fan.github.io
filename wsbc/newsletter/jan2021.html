  <p>Dotted throughout history, we can see examples of sport’s innate ability to bring people together. Few events are able to bring together cultures from across the globe like the Olympics or the World Cup. Closer to home, the World Junior Hockey Championship has become a holiday tradition, with viewers tuning in from communities coast-to-coast even if they don’t typically watch the sport. However, with rising costs for youth sport and limited programming available for disability sport, the same togetherness and inclusivity cannot be found within grassroots sports.</p>

  <p>A large factor contributing to poor programs for disability sport are inaccessible facilities and a lack of specialized equipment. Many municipalities (who typically organize the programming) often don’t have enough facilities (accessible community centres) to keep up with the demand for these programs and families may be priced out of options with private organizations. Further contributing to issues with the integration of parasport is a lack of online access, according to research by the University of Alberta. Most of the 127 national and provincial sport organizations examined did not mention programs available for people with disabilities, and if they did, it was merely a small section with some contact information to learn more. Making sports more accessible to people with disabilities (and thus increasing participation), especially kids, is instrumental for reducing obesity (which has become increasingly common in children with disabilities) and helps to improve cognitive performance in children who suffer from neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

  <p>Cost has become an increasingly prohibitive element when it comes to youth sports participation. Hockey, one of Canada’s national sports, has been usurped by other sports when Canadian parents were surveyed on what sports they would be registering their children in (according to research conducted by Ipsos). With the cost of equipment for junior hockey players averaging $740 (according to CBC) on top of registration fees, other sports have become more financially feasible. This could lead to a continued reduction in the number of players in the developmental pipeline, posing a problem for the future of the elite Canadian hockey program.</p>

  <p>While there is still a long way to go, many sporting organizations have made continued improvements towards increasing the awareness of disability sport and affordability of sports through charitable initiatives and programs. Post your thoughts in the Facebook post comments on how accessibility can be improved in youth sport!</p>

    <h2>Industry Insights with Tristan Bogler</h2>
  <div class='w3-center w3-margin-bottom'><img src='../img/newsletter/jan2021-tristan.jpg' class='w3-round-xxlarge small-img sq' /></div>
  <p>This month, we spoke with the Manager of Philanthropy for Hockey Canada, Tristan Bogler! Tristan graduated from Western University in 2014 and went onto to complete his MBA at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management. Tristan is currently responsible for overseeing and improving revenue generation for Hockey Canada’s various charitable programs. Special thanks to Tristan for taking the time to share with us all the great work that Hockey Canada is doing! If you would like to learn more about Hockey Canada, feel free to reach out to Tristan through <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristan-bogler/' class='text-link'>LinkedIn!</a></p>
  <p style="font-weight:bold">WSBC: Hockey is arguably the most popular sport in Canada, however it also the most expensive to play. What is Hockey Canada doing to allow underprivileged youth a chance to play the game?</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Tristan:</span> I’ll start with some of the programs and activities that we have going on right now. Firstly, the Hockey Canada Assist Fund, which was born as a direct result of COVID-19. We are pledging $1,000,000 (along with 100% of donations) to be dispersed coast-to-coast to help people cover the cost of registration fees in an effort to kids playing. The Assist Fund is really pushing towards improving access to grassroots hockey, which has really been hit by the pandemic. We also have the “Dreams Come True” program that has introduced hockey to 1,300 kids since 2006. It also helps to subsidize registration fees, but more than that helps to provide equipment to underprivileged youth across the country. Hockey Canada has also pledged $3,000,000 to the “Hockey is Hers” campaign to build a long-term positive impact on the female game. There are three strategic initiatives associated with this: development of female coaching, building a strong base of female players, and continued support of the Women’s National Team. They (Women’s National Team) serves as a beacon for the continued growth of the game. Overall, our big thing is grassroots hockey; figuring out how can we build a solid base layer of up-and-coming players and support them along their journey through junior then professional hockey.</p>

  <p style="font-weight:bold">WSBC: What challenges do you face when implementing these programs?</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Tristan:</span> We don’t really face any more difficult challenges that any other charity organization would. Obviously right now the economic situation has been about as bad as it has ever been and has affected the ability for people to help our cause. I will say as Canada’s game, hockey holds a special place in Canadians hearts and having 35 million fans really helps. All of our exceptional partners like Chevrolet and BFL Canada have also really supported us with our mission through the pandemic and beyond.</p>

  <p style="font-weight:bold">WSBC: What are your thoughts on what can be done to further improve accessibility within sport?</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Tristan:</span> Actually, as part of the Assist Fund, we have 3 major alumni sponsors: Jerome Iginla (former Canadian Men’s National Team player), Marie-Phillip Poulin (Captain of Canadian Women’s National Team), and Greg Westlake (Canadian National Para Hockey Team player) who really represent Hockey Canada’s holistic view of hockey. We strive to get people playing the game whether they are able-bodied or not and truly believe that hockey is a sport for anyone. In regard to diversity and inclusion, personally I was a little disappointed in the NHL’s lack of support towards the Hockey Diversity Alliance (HDA). However, I was excited to see the CEO of Hockey Canada, Tom Renney, pledge his allegiance to the HDA. I think we are headed in the right direction and I’m really excited for the next generation of leaders to continue to push for equality.</p>
