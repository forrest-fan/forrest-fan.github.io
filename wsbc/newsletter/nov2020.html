  <p>Billy Beane’s pioneering use of sabermetrics, which propelled the frugal 2002 Oakland Athletics to an American League West title, set the stage for data analytics to ingratiate itself across all facets of many sports organizations over the following decade. From auto sports to racquet sports, the collection and analysis of big data has helped athletes and general manager’s alike to maximize performance in a cost-effective manner. With today’s technological advances, gathering and applying numbers to achieve goals has never been easier, but how far can teams take data analytics before it affects the unknown; the factor which makes sports special. 
  </p><p>
  At the beginning of the 2010-2011 NBA season, four teams began using SportVU; a camera system born from military technology designed to provide teams with statistical information from the X, Y positioning of players and the X, Y, Z positioning of the ball. Franchises were able to track data that could never be found in a traditional box score to help gain a competitive advantage. Fast forward to 2017, a partnership between Wimbledon and IBM blended artificial intelligence into the formula, adding another layer to data collection, this time to the benefit of fans. The “Wimbledon Cognitive Highlights Solution” incorporated match data, player expressions, and crowd noise to filter through hundreds of hours of match video, resulting in high quality highlight packages. This allowed more time for Wimbledon’s editorial team to work on other projects and bring more content to the masses. Unique data applications such as this should only evolve in the near future as 5G technology becomes more sophisticated and companies are able to provide real-time tracking. 
  </p><p>
  Decision-makers use the vast amount of data compiled throughout the years to make choices on franchise-changing events like the draft. For the most part the fallout of these selections is contained to the team, but some data-charged philosophies have influenced the way certain sports are played entirely. Baseball managers have access to data in the dugout and it is often used to find ideal matchups for their pitchers; leading to some relief pitchers only throwing to one batter and then being substituted for a teammate with better numbers versus an upcoming hitter. Facing much backlash from traditionalists of the game, the MLB moved toward a three-batter minimum rule this past season, aiming to cut down the average time per game. The rule change will also likely phase out the “lefty one-out” pitchers and disadvantage some teams. 
  </p><p> 
  While the jury is still out as to how far sports teams are able to push sports analytics, the impact it has already had on the industry is profound. Going forward, executives will have to strike a balance between advancing the game and alienating the rich history each sport has. </p>

  <h2>Industry Insights with Alex Wong</h2>
  <div class='w3-center w3-margin-bottom'><img src='../img/newsletter/nov2020-alex.jpg' class='w3-round-xxlarge small-img' /></div>
  <p>This month, we spoke with the newly minted Vice President of Strategy & Analytics for the Toronto Blue Jays, Alex Wong! A fellow Mustang and Ivey grad (HBA ’10), Alex is currently responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of organizational strategy and business analytics across business operations for the Jays. Special thanks to Alex for taking the time to give us a look into an emerging sector!</p>
  <p style="font-weight:bold">WSBC: Baseball is very much still a sport where we can see a divide between an “old-school” and “new-school” train of thought. How do the Blue Jays strike a balance between the numbers and the “eye-test”?</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Alex:</span> While the adoption of data and analytics has been wide-spread across the sports side of MLB, similar adoption has lagged on the business side. One of the challenges has been the quality and availability of data. Over the last few years we’ve focused on enhancing both of these things while simultaneously starting to embed data into our decision making processes to prove the value of the “new-school” approach. But, for all the power that data has to offer, it still has to be contextualized to the unique circumstances of the business to drive meaningful results – it requires a marriage with the “old-school”. Finding the right balance between the two has been an iterative process which has evolved through a lot of trial and error.</p>
  <p style="font-weight:bold">WSBC: Data analysis is a major part of player evaluation for a modern sports team and has found its way to off-field applications like dynamic ticket pricing. Where do you see the next evolution for sports analytics?</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Alex:</span> Data and analytics is starting to touch every part of our business, but there are two areas which I’m really excited about. The first area is around creating a better fan experience. Combining data and analytics with emerging technologies to create a seamless experience for fans for everything from their entry experience, to food and beverage, to in-game entertainment. The second area that data and analytics can really unlock is personalized and automated marketing. Being able to understand what content is relevant to fans and the channels and formats through which they are most influenced will help drive stronger engagement and greater conversion.</p>

  <p style="font-weight:bold">WSBC: Despite being a multi-billion-dollar market, sports analytics isn’t exactly cookie-cutter field. What can a student be doing to put themselves in position for a future role in analytics?</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Alex:</span> There really isn’t one path into sports analytics, but there are few things I would recommend to students to help position themselves for a role. Start by building a foundation in statistics and business and working on a few technical skills such as statistical modeling (R, Python) and data visualization (Tableau). At the same time, try to build connections within the industry to get a better sense of what teams are looking for and what opportunities exist. And the last thing is to not give up. The sports industry is small and the path into it isn’t always linear. Building a CV with analytics experience outside of sports can help make you a strong candidate when positions do come up.</p>
