<div class="container collapse">
  <p>Last year, five-star recruits LaMelo Ball and RJ Hampton took their talents to Oceania’s National Basketball League, rebuffing the traditional college route. However uncommon, it was nothing new having seen Emmanuel Mudiay and Brandon Jennings jet across the Pacific and return to have successful NBA careers. The choice is enticing, a head start on a professional basketball career with no school to worry about and the freedom to pursue lucrative sponsorship deals. NBA brass seem to have keyed in on these perks and have come up with a solution of their own with the introduction of the G League Ignite Team back in April. Offering elite players one-year of development under the tutelage of NBA level coaches, up to $500,000 in salary, and a full scholarship to Arizona State University, the program provides a legitimate threat to the current NCAA system. Though, they say competition breeds change, and the NCAA is looking to do just that.</p>

  <p>With the NCAA board of governors’ approval to allow student-athletes to benefit from the use of their name, image, and likeness, college sports are finally absolved of one of the biggest criticisms to its student athlete model. Schools will be able to use this as a bargaining chip in recruitment, particularly for top-level prospects. Even if a school’s primary targets aren’t swooned by this, there should be no shortage of other players looking to take their place at a legendary program such as the one at Duke University. While these players may not be considered ‘top-tier’ when they enter college, many get launched into stardom come the annual March Madness tournament. Take Stephen Curry for example, lightly recruited out of high school, he went on to carry mid-major Davidson to two Cinderella runs at the NCAA tournament over his three years at the school. Curry would then convert his post-secondary success into two MVP’s and three championships at the sport’s highest level.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the NCAA will have to continue to make more changes if they hope to maintain their current level of success. Backlash came of the sponsorship decision with some lawmakers looking to introduce a legislatorial speed bump that would impose an income tax on the scholarships of college athletes looking to cash-in on the new regulations. TV ratings may also suffer if big stars are lured away from the college ranks in search of greener pastures. </p>

  <p>College sports has faced no greater danger than the situation they find themselves in today. But perhaps the legendary voice of NCAA basketball, Dick Vitale, said it best: “College basketball has always been about the name on the front of the jersey, not the back.”</p>

  <h2>Industry Insights with Jack Armstrong</h2>
  <div class='w3-center w3-margin-bottom'><img src='../img/newsletter/oct2020-jack.jpg' class='w3-round-xxlarge small-img' /></div>
  <p>This month, we picked the brain of iconic Canadian basketball figure Jack Armstrong! He is currently an NBA analyst for TSN covering the Toronto Raptors and college basketball. Special thanks to Jack for taking the time to give his two cents on what the NCAA faces.</p>
  <p style="font-weight:bold">WSBC: Is the NCAA really in danger with the decision by the NBA to introduce the new G League Select Team?</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Jack:</span> I'd say the NCAA is very concerned at the highest level when you talk about potentially some of the elite prospects skipping college to go right to the G League. It doesn't impact the lesser schools that much, though there is a trickle-down effect in terms of recruiting targets, but it directly impacts powers like Duke, UNC, Kentucky, Kansas, UCLA, etc... [there is] more competition for the best players. Fascinating stuff for sure.</p>

  <p style="font-weight:bold">WSBC: Thoughts on recruits going overseas for a year? (How do you think the cultural differences [on and off the court] impact their development?)</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Jack:</span> Recruits going overseas is a much more mixed topic. Big challenges with maturity and ability to adapt to a new culture, language, style of play, etc... in a short period of time. In addition, not sure how 'invested' teams will be overseas in guys that are there for the short term. They don't like to be used for that. I think the G League option better fits the model for a North American prospect than a short stint overseas.</p>

  <p style="font-weight:bold">WSBC: What’s your opinion on the NCAA’s ruling to allow student-athletes to benefit from the use of their name?</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Jack:</span> I like it. They absolutely should be able to benefit from their likeness. Only the elite few players will make any major $$ off of this. Nonetheless, this still gives athletes the ability to have further control over their 'brand'. A step in the right direction.</p>
