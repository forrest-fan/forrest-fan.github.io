  <h2>Bills Fans Donate Over $600K to Children's Hospital in Honor of Quarterback Josh Allen's Late Grandmother</h2>

  <p>In week 9 of the NFL season, the Buffalo Bills took down the Seattle Seahawks in convincing fashion. The Seahawks came to town as one of the top Super Bowl contenders and with MVP frontrunner Russell Wilson, however they were no match for Buffalo’s franchise quarterback Josh Allen. The third year quarterback played arguably the best game of his career and it couldn’t have come at a better time. The Bills were under fire for not having beat a great football team yet but more importantly Josh Allen was playing emotional football following the passing of his grandmother Patricia Allen, the evening prior to the game. When the media released the news after the game, Bills Mafia wasted no time showing their support for the fan favourite quarterback. The Buffalo fan base started donating increments of $17 to a local children’s hospital, representing Allen’s jersey number. They did so to honour Allen’s grandmother and they were able to raise over $600,000 to Oishei children’s hospital, including a $17,000 donation from Allen himself. Allen has been a volunteer at the hospital on many occasions and made an array of public statements stressing how thankful he was to the Bills Mafia. The Oishei hospital also is planning to honour the late Patricia Allen in some form and intends to let Allen determine how he would like the money to be directed. OCH President Allegra Jaros told NFL.com, “It will be special to the family to see her name show up in a way that celebrates her life.”</p>

  <h2>NHL, Adidas reveal 'Reverse Retro' alternate jerseys for all 31 teams</h2>

  <p>Late last month, the NHL revealed 31 brand new “Reverse Retro” jerseys for all of it’s teams. The NHL was looking to create a buzz around the hockey community as fans await the arrival of next season. Partnered with Adidas hockey, the NHL has been working on this release for some time now and given the lack of ticket sales due to the pandemic, this was the perfect time. The release featured the return of some iconic looks with a fresh new twist, as well as brand new looks for some of hockey’s most storied franchises. With the NHL season set to begin again in a couple of months, this gives fans the opportunity to add the perfect gift to their Christmas list and be ready to cheer on their favourite team.</p>

  <h2>Trade between Wizards & Rockets shakes NBA Landscape</h2>
  <div class="w3-center">
    <img src="../img/newsletter/qh-dec2020-westbrookwall.jpg" class="w3-round-xxlarge newsHeadImg"/>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <p>Last week the Washington Wizards acquired superstar point guard Russell Westbrook from the Houston Rockets, in exchange for their oft-injured franchise point guard John Wall. This gives Washington the opportunity to pair the consistent veteran Westbrook with their young all star shooting guard Bradley Beal as they look to get back to the playoffs. As for the Rockets, it was an attempt to keep hold of one of the best scorers in the history of basketball James Harden, who has been vocal about his desire to leave Houston. What might seem like a simple one for one trade from two teams desperate to have the right pieces around their best players, is so much more than that. If Harden were to be dealt elsewhere, the NBA could see the addition of another super-team much like we have seen in Golden State and Miami in recent years. Harden has expressed interest in playing for the Brooklyn Nets that would pair him with two top ten players in the league, building a team that would be tough to stop. This trade sends ripples through the NBA much further than the nation’s capital and one of Texas’ biggest city’s. Teams are desperate to assemble the best team possible, mortgaging their futures to win now. It’s an exciting time to be an NBA fan and until the first tip off is thrown, anything can happen.</p>
