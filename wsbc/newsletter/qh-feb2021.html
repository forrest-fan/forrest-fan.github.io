  <h2>Near-fatal Car Accident puts Tiger Woods Professional Golf Career in Jeopardy</h2>
  <div class="w3-center">

  <br/>
  <p>Most importantly, Tiger Woods is alive. However, he suffered major injuries in a devastating car accident that left him hospitalized and flirting with the “jaws of life”.</p>
  <p>In the early afternoon of February 23, arguably the most polarizing figure in sports was involved in a single-car crash that saw his SUV roll off the highway and onto a Los Angeles hillside. The site of the crash saw Tiger trapped inside the vehicle where he suffered “major leg injuries”, leaving him unable to stand on his own power according to his agent, Mark Steinberg. After a 2017 run-in with the law, where Tiger was found behind the wheel with five drugs in his system, it wasn’t unreasonable for the media to fear for the worst.  Although, when authorities arrived at the scene, they found Tiger conscious and alert, determining that he was not under the influence while driving the vehicle. Tiger did, however, look “agitated and impatient” as he left his hotel for a golf lesson at seven in the morning. This was according to a TV director who was staying at the same hotel and saw Tiger nearly miss another vehicle as he left the parking lot “very fast”. Tiger will not face charges following the crash, but that doesn’t mean he’s walking away scot-free.</p>
  <p>Tiger Woods isn’t getting any younger; at forty-five years old, he will have to recover from extensive surgery that will keep him away from the course for an unknown length of time. Fortunately, Tiger is no stranger to adversity; having had five knee surgeries and five back surgeries throughout the entirety of his career. It is unclear whether he can come back again from his first leg surgery and traumatic car accident, but he has shown fans time and time again that he should never be forgotten about. It should be intriguing to see how Tiger responds this summer as he enters the twilight of his career. Although, it is probably a longshot that he decides to quit playing, it’s possible he will take that route in order to focus on getting healthy for retirement.</p>
  <p>When that day comes, it’s sure to send the golfing world into a crash of its own given his undeniable influence on the sport since day one.</p>

  <h2>Does Super LV Cement Brady as the NFL’s Forever “G.O.A.T”?</h2>
  <div class="w3-center">

  <br/>
  <p>With seven Super Bowl rings on two different teams and an undefeated playoff record against Mahomes, it is hard to deny the degree of difficulty that will come with another quarterback eventually dethroning Brady as the NFL’s G.O.A.T.</p>
  <p>In Super Bowl LV, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the favourite Kansas City Chiefs in dramatic fashion. Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady played a near-perfect game, leading his team to a 31-9 victory despite being a heavy underdog. The discussion leading up to this game evolved around the idea that Brady; with a win, could make it impossible for Mahomes to ever surpass his legacy.</p>
  <p>Patrick Mahomes is widely regarded as the league’s best player, already having a league MVP, Super Bowl, and Super Bowl MVP to his name. At just 25 years old, fans believe that Mahomes may be the best candidate to ever take over Brady’s spot as the greatest quarterback of all time. However, most define “success” as a matter of wins or losses, rather than purely producing other-worldly statistics. With that being said, Mahomes, barring-injury, will likely surpass Brady’s record for passing touchdowns and passing yards. What that doesn’t guarantee is Mahomes winning at the same level as Brady, who not only has seven championships but now one against Mahomes himself. Mahomes had the chance to keep Brady at six rings while achieving his second by the age of 25, something no other quarterback has done in the sport’s rich history. Tom Brady included wasn’t able to capture a second Super Bowl before his 26th birthday, but what might be even more impressive is his four rings after turning 37, with the most recent win coming at the age of 43.</p>
  <p>Mahomes has a chance to shatter all of Brady’s passing records but it’s hard to say he will ever dominate the game at a championship level like Brady has since starting his first NFL start in 2001. Nothing in sports is more important than winning and Tom Brady is the ultimate winner; wherever he goes, it seems as if success is destined to follow suit regardless of his opponent.</p>

  <h2>NHL’s Sunny Weekend at Lake Tahoe Turns Problematic for TV Ratings</h2>
  <div class="w3-center">
    <img src="../img/newsletter/qh-feb2021-tahoe.jpg" class="w3-round-xxlarge newsHeadImg"/>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <p>The gorgeous Lake Tahoe played host to two NHL games this past weekend, the first of which saw sunny skies melt away the leagues chance to increase viewership in an effort to make up for lost revenue due to Covid-19.</p>
  <p>Scheduled for 12:00 p.m. PST, the Colorado Avalanche and Vegas Golden Knights were set to face off in a matchup featuring two of the league’s more stable powerhouses. Following a beautiful opening ceremony that honoured a few of Nevada’s most courageous officers, Avalanche defencemen Samuel Girard opened the scoring with a long-range wrister less than three minutes into the first period. Shortly after, the greatest skaters on Earth were struggling to keep their balance even while harmlessly skating to the bench. The NHL finished the first period before delaying the game because of safety concerns caused by the weak conditions of the ice surface. It didn’t take long for commissioner Gary Bettman to decide the game would need to be played at a later time despite the picture-perfect setting that afternoon. He went as far as to say the conditions were the toughest the NHL has ever faced in the history of its outdoor events, “We’ve done over 30 outdoor games, this has been the most difficult weather circumstance we’ve had, and it’s a beautiful day. But if you look up at the sun, the cloud cover is everywhere but where the sun is, and it did a number on the ice.” Thus, the decision was made to reschedule the game to 9:00 p.m. PST.</p>
  <p>Rescheduling the game to 9:00 p.m. PST was disastrous for the NHL because it meant the game would not resume until midnight on the East Coast; where the majority of the NHL’s viewers reside. The remainder of the game was exciting up until the final buzzer, featuring a highlight reel goal from league superstar Nathan MacKinnon, and an eerie backdrop of the great outdoors. Nonetheless, it was too late for the league’s East Coast fans to stay awake watching and ultimately dropped TV ratings to a mere 0.20 or 361,000 viewers. It was disappointing in comparison to the 1.36 million viewers that tuned into the first period. For a league that has been financially dismantled by the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, the NHL was banking on the hopes that this marquee match-up could generate the money that they so desperately need.</p>
  <p>It’s safe to say that Covid-19 has evaporated businesses wallets for the better part of a year now, even on the sunniest of days. Unfortunately for the NHL, their business is no different.</p>
