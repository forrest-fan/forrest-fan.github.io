  <p>The divisional round of the NFL playoffs this past Sunday featured quarterback duels of all ages, setting up highly anticipated battles in Green Bay and Kansas City next weekend.</p>
  <p>The Buffalo Bills, Kansas City Chiefs, Green Bay Packers, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers all booked their ticket to the NFL championship weekend with wins against a handful of tough opponents. The four teams will be looking for a shot at Super Bowl LV, that will be held in Tampa Bay on February 7th, 2021. The matchups this upcoming Sunday, provide fans with exciting quarterback matchups between some of the most talked about players in the league this season.</p>
  <p>In Kansas City, for the AFC championship, the game will feature two of the game’s best young gunslingers in Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes. Mahomes was last year’s Super Bowl MVP while Allen will be looking for his first trip to the big game after being in the MVP race for most of the regular season. Buffalo will be looking to advance to their first Super Bowl since 1993 and are hoping they can win the grand prize for the first time in the team’s history. In the NFC championship, thirty-five year old Aaron Rodgers will take on forty-three year old Tom Brady, in a battle between two of footballs best quarterbacks of all time. The Tampa Buccaneers and Green Bay Packers will be looking for their second Super Bowl trips of the century as they fight on the frozen tundra in Green Bay. These matchups provide many storylines to an already interesting season for the NFL and it will be exciting to see which of these star quarterbacks will square off in the Super Bowl next month. This year, the NFL’s ratings have reigned supreme over all four North American major sports. With two highly anticipated matchups this Sunday, fans have good reason to tune in and spend yet another Sunday in front of the TV.</p>

  <h2>2020-2021 NHL Season Opens with Successful First Night of Games</h2>
  <div class="w3-center">

  <p>The NHL season is back; and even without North America’s greatest arenas being full, the league had a successful opening night with a five-game slate that featured some of the league’s greatest rivalries.</p>
  <p>The world’s greatest hockey league has had to adapt to a new season that brings along four new divisions and only 56 games. Teams will only play games within their division which means they will have the chance to play each of those opponents nine or ten times throughout the season’s entirety. This should cause a rift between teams like never before, creating a playoff style feel to games all year long.</p>
  <p>The night opened with a 6-3 Flyers slashing of their rival Penguins. This game was followed by a classic opening night Habs vs. Leafs showdown that saw Toronto take the victory 5-4 in overtime. The Canucks defeated the Oilers, Lightning beat the Blackhawks, and the Blues took down the Avalanche to finish what was a very exciting night for hockey fans from all over.</p>
  <p>The NHL seems to have done a great job in providing its audience with enough entertainment to keep them seated on the couch with the TV on.</p>

  <h2>Blue Jays hit offseason Home Run in George Springer</h2>
  <div class="w3-center">
    <img src="../img/newsletter/qh-jan2021-springer.jpg" class="w3-round-xxlarge newsHeadImg"/>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <p>On Tuesday night the Toronto Blue Jays made the biggest offseason splash in the club’s history; signing marquee free agent George Springer, taking a step towards a new era of baseball north of the border.</p>
  <p>First reported by Brandon Kuhn, former Astros slugger George Springer signed a 6-year, $150 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays late Tuesday night. After the 2016 season, the Blue Jays went into rebuild mode, banking on young pieces like Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Cavan Biggio, and Bo Bichette to carry the torch to the clubs next playoff run. After a few seasons of development for the young stars, the Blue Jays re-entered the postseason this fall, ultimately leading to general manager Ross Atkins finally taking the steps to build around these kids.</p>
  <p>Adding Springer makes things very interesting for the Blue Jays with their now crowded outfield. Some speculate they could look to make a deal to move Lourdes Gurriel Jr. for another arm for their pitching rotation. Making this kind of a move can make the Blue Jays a true playoff contender within a division that features some of the league’s best pitching staffs.</p>
  <p>For the Toronto Blue Jays, George Springer does more than just add an extra 20-30 homeruns to an already promising lineup. It makes the lone Canadian franchise a relevant team again with true playoff prose.</p>
