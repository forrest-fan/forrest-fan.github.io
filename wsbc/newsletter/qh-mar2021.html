  <h2>The (Not-So) Great Sports Depression</h2>

  <p>Sports has long been known for bringing people together, but with the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic doing the opposite, the implications have stemmed far from the field of play.</p>
  <p>The evening of March 11th, 2020 was like any other for NBA fans who scanned their tickets and entered the Chesapeake Energy Arena - hoping to catch the hometown Oklahoma City Thunder take on the visiting Utah Jazz. However, it was determined during the pre-game warmups that Jazz center, Rudy Gobert, had tested positive for the ‘novel’ coronavirus and immediately a regular night at the arena became one that the world would remember forever. What followed was a long hiatus for sports, that saw all major leagues be cancelled, only to play for empty stadiums upon their return.</p>
  <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has affected the sporting world in a way that no one could have foreseen. It’s easy to see the affect it has had on the excitement level of professional sports, given the lack of attendance at events. However, the pandemic causing fans to stay home, has sent shockwaves through the industry, demanding that leagues adjust for years to come. Financially, professional leagues rely heavily on ticket sales to generate revenue and in turn, spend on player contracts and the regulation of salary capacities – the NHL specifically, sees 70% of its revenue come from game-day sales inside the arena. A great example of the effect on the salary cap comes in the NFL, where teams saw the salary cap decrease by 8% in comparison to last season. That may seem insignificant on paper, but teams lost out on 15.7 million dollars; ultimately being forced to release/restructure the contracts of key pieces on their roster.</p>
  <p>Away from the professional playing field, organizations have involuntarily laid-off a number of employees and cut salaries, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. At Bell Media, over 200 employees were laid-off – including big names from TSN, such as Dan O’Toole and Natasha Staniszewski.</p>
  <p>It’s impossible to ignore the repercussions that the sports industry has faced in the span of just over a year and even more disappointing to see hard-working individuals lose their jobs. However, teams are finally starting to scan tickets again for their beloved fans with the increased doses of vaccines being distributed. It’s safe to say there’s hope sports may be back before we know it, right when we need them the most.</p>

  <h2>NFL Announces 17-Game Schedule for 2021 Season</h2>
  <div class="w3-center">

  <br/>
  <p>For the first time since 1978, the NFL won’t play a sixteen-game regular season. However, the expansion to seventeen games has provoked mixed reviews from players, management, and fans alike.</p>
  <p>The idea of a 17th NFL game looks great on paper – it’s another game for fans to watch, players to play, and broadcasts to broadcast. However, the final week of the NFL season has often been identified as a week of ‘mean-nothing’ games, aside from the few and far between that have playoff implications. For the most part, the league’s biggest stars take the week off to prepare for playoff matchups which, in return, lowers the quality of the game. From a player’s perspective, they value the week off, given the physical exhaustion their bodies endure over the course of the season. While keeping that in mind, a 17th game is a good excuse for fans to spend another Sunday on the couch, regardless of how good the football is. The NFL desires additional revenue to make up for what they’ve lose due to Covid-19 and they are clearly willing to do whatever it takes to earn it.</p>
  <p>The NFL makes more money than any other professional sports league on the planet, generating an exceptional $15 billion dollars in revenue per year. However, this may come at the expense of the well-being of their 32 franchises. A seventeen-game slate is another example in a long list of ways the NFL has failed to do what’s best for their teams. Not only does the expanded schedule overwork the league’s players, but it puts some teams at a disadvantage because the number of games played is now uneven. The effect of this decision means some teams will play nine home games, while others play eight – whereas the sixteen-game schedule ensured every team would play the same number of home and road games (that being eight). For NFL teams, it can be argued that home field advantage is more vital than in any other league. Stripping these rights from teams and their players can lead to problems in the league, internally – players and teams could be motivated to strike which means no games for fans or money for the league.</p>
  <p>The NFL needs to continue to search for the perfect balance for its fans, players, organizations, and the league itself. It will be interesting to see if the seventeen-game schedule does the trick despite the initial controversy.</p>

  <h2>The Leaf’s Kawhi Leonard</h2>
  <div class="w3-center">

  </div>
  <br/>
  <p>With the recent approval of a shortened quarantine for NHL players ahead of the trade deadline, the Toronto Maple Leaf’s have yet another reason to be buyers, on top of desperately needing to conclude their recent playoff woes.</p>
  <p>It can be argued that the Leaf’s own the most talented roster in the NHL, with the likes of Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner, Morgan Reilly, and several other marquee players. It can also be argued, however, that they play in one of the tougher markets in North American sports. Their fans expect the best on a nightly basis, especially when the spring arrives. After losing in the first round of the playoffs the previous three seasons, the pressure is stronger than ever for the Leaf’s to perform, while their stars are in the prime of their respective careers.</p>
  <p>The NHL trade deadline gives teams a chance to bulk their rosters in preparation for the season that counts – taking expandable players out of lesser team’s lineups in exchange for draft picks and prospects. Due to Covid-19, the list of players has expanded, giving the Leaf’s a unique opportunity to add big-name players to their roster and ensure they can make a playoff run come May. This year, the trade deadline could see its biggest star in years be dealt – Taylor Hall. Hall signed a one-year deal with the Buffalo Sabres this offseason, and after Buffalo fell out of the playoff race early on, the team isn’t very confident that Hall will choose to resign this summer. If Toronto is willing to mortgage a significant portion of its future for the chance to win a cup this season, Hall would be worth the, price given he might just be the Leaf’s key missing piece.</p>
  <p>The Leaf’s have arguably the strongest top six forward group in the NHL, but with the one missing piece coming on the second line, adding Hall would make the Leaf’s top-six forwards the NHL’s undisputed best. Rather than adding spare parts to weaker areas of the roster on defence and in net, the Leaf’s can play to their strengths – ultimately making up for a lack of back-end skill. The NHL is more balanced on scoring than ever before and the recent cup winners have been able to do it better than anyone, specifically last year’s Tampa Bay Lightning.</p>
  <p>Toronto sports fans have seen the impact that trading for a star can have on the team – having seen the Raptors finally break their string of playoff woes, similar to those of the Leaf’s, in 2019. Adding Hall to the roster sends a message to the league, the players, and the fans that the Leaf’s want to win, and it could be exactly what they need in order to win Lord Stanley for the first time since 1967.</p>
