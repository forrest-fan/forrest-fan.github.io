  <p>While America was struggling to take a stand to the COVID-19 pandemic this summer, an innocent black man named George Floyd was killed by Minnesota police over a counterfeit $20 bill. Over the next few months, American citizens took charge and showed that they were understandably sick of racial injustice within the United States. Amongst the protesters were some of the biggest names in professional sports, who took advantage of their international platform to voice their distress. Professional athletes have had the spotlight needed to make a change and it is very important for them, and their respective leagues, to show their fans that there are issues going on around our globe that are bigger than sports. That being said, in what ways were these athletes able to show their support for the black community in a year affected by a pandemic?</p>

  <p>Professional leagues and their athletes posted on social media, attended protests, and spoke at BLM movements to prove their point. In order to support the black community they even went as far as cancelling games and supporting athletes and coaches kneeling for the national anthem despite the backlash that has been associated with such actions in the past. A large portion of athletes from different backgrounds in the NFL, NHL, MLB, and NBA locked arms as a sign of unity on national television to show the world the importance of being united. They made sure viewers could see BLM messages on the backs of players jerseys, helmets, and stadium advertisements. This sent the message that they were committed to a movement thats bigger than their own contracts, statistics, or love of the game. Although professional leagues have put a lot of focus on this important movement, they can not be stagnant in their future plans on how they can combat racial discrimination in our society.</p>

  <p>Moving forward, these leagues and their athletes need to continue to use their platform to show their support for the black community and be an integral piece of the BLM movement and equality for all. Players like Lebron James, who has over 70 million followers on Instagram and multiple endorsement deals with global brands like Nike, can use those tools to broadcast their actions in support of BLM to the world. These athletes have a lot of people who look up to them, as leaders to the youth, and have the power and platforms to educate new generations about the importance of equality and to learn from mistakes made in the past, to prevent anything like this happening again. </p>

  <p>Professional athletes and their respective leagues have the power to show America and the world that we truly are “stronger together.”</p>
